# Description
The *generate_custom_archive.sh* script mimics what kbuild does for distros, targeting custom kernel instead.
In short, starting from a compiled custom kernel, it can generate a .tar.gz with the same format of those generated by kbuild, making it suitable for kernel build using the *kernel_module* bazel rule.

This is particularly useful for generating .tar.gz packages to be used for testing,
since most of the kernel config used for testing are usually disabled in the debian and ubuntu repositories (e.g. KUnit).

The *buildroot_2020.11.2-Add-scripts-and-config-for-kunit-rootfs-image.patch* patch can be applied to buildroot 2020.11.2 release (should work for newer releases as well, the patch doesn't change buildroot internal) to generate a slim 60MiB image, suitable for executing KUnit tests defined through the *kernel_test* bazel rule.
This patch does the following:
* Provide buildroot with a sane default configuration for the kernel testing use case
* Provide the *kunit_post_build.sh* script. Buildroot will run this script after generating the rootfs image to:
  * Modify the default getty prompt to a simple shell, bypassing the login prompt
  * Add a new startup script (*run_kunit_tests.sh*)
* Provide the *run_kunit_tests.sh* script which:
  * Mounts the hostfs
  * Loads all kernel modules available there (triggering kunit tests execution)

# Workflow to generate a custom kernel archive
1. Download the kernel source code from somewhere into $KDIR
   * `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/torvalds/linux.git $KDIR && cd $KDIR`
2. Configure and compile the kernel
   * `export ARCH=x # x being the architecture you want to compile the kernel for.`
   * `make defconfig && make menuconfig # Enable/disable stuff.`
   * `make`
   * Note: at this point, you have generated a `linux` file as well. This is a kernel executable image.
     If you previously specified `ARCH=um`, and enabled KUnit in the config, this image can be used by *kernel_test* rules.
     Documentation about the *kernel_test* rule can be found [here](https://github.com/enfabrica/enkit/blob/master/bazel/linux/README.md).
3. Execute the script and generate the .tar.gz inside $OUTDIR for your kernel version $KVER
   * `$ENKIT_REPO/kbuild/utils/generate_custom_archive.sh -k $KDIR -t $OUTDIR -v $KVER`
4. Optional: upload the .tar.gz using astore and make it public
   * `enkit astore upload $OUTDIR/$KVER.tar.gz@my/astore/path -a $ARCH`
   * `enkit astore public my/astore/path -a $ARCH`

# Workflow to generate a custom rootfs image
1. Download buildroot release 2020.11.2 (or a newer one if you prefer)
   * `wget https://github.com/buildroot/buildroot/archive/refs/tags/2020.02.12.tar.gz`
2. Apply the local buildroot patch
   * `git am buildroot_2020.11.2-Add-scripts-and-config-for-kunit-rootfs-image.patch`
3. Optional: modify the default buildroot config
   * `make menuconfig # Modify the default provided by the patch`
4. Generate the rootfs image
   * `make`
5. The image can be found in `output/images`
