WEB UI
- Minimal web interface with wizard (gsuite authenticated)
- Button has the user authenticate via github.
- At completion, mapping between user and enfabrica email is saved.

- if user is not part of the enfabrica organization, an invite is sent.
- based on gsuite groups, add user to corresponding github groups.


from CLI? URL to authenticate via github? not sure it makes sense?
workflow has to be completed via browser? (well, could use the GH_TOKEN,
a local token or key)
