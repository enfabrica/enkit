New user in the organization: is emailed a link like "github.service.enfabrica.net/tokentokentokentoken"
User kicked out of the organization (or needs to refresh groups): has to visit me.service.enfabrica.net

Page structure:
1) long term, fields that we want the user to modify on his/her own
2) short term, just the github username

"Your current github username is: ...."

"You are part of the groups: ...."

[change] [update groups]

"Last github activity: ..."


"Your github account is not configured"
[get started by authenticating]

check github username is set up correctly
[check again]

set github username in contacts API

set github username in datastore

invite username in organization

fetch groups from google -> list groups



or
New 

me.service.enfabrica.net


WEB UI
- Minimal web interface with wizard (gsuite authenticated)
- Button has the user authenticate via github.
- At completion, mapping between user and enfabrica email is saved.

- if user is not part of the enfabrica organization, an invite is sent.
- based on gsuite groups, add user to corresponding github groups.


from CLI? URL to authenticate via github? not sure it makes sense?
workflow has to be completed via browser? (well, could use the GH_TOKEN,
a local token or key)
