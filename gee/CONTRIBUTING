# CONTRIBUTING

This is an effort to re-implement the gee bash script in python.

## Goals

A few high level objectives:

  * implement gee as a stand-alone python3 script that can be executed
    directly from the command line, without using any python modules
    that aren't part of the python standard library.  Gee shouldn't
    need to be a pyzip file or be executed via `bazel run`.

  * configure gee.py using a .gee.rc file.  geerc.default is a prototype.

  * remove all enfabrica-isms from the gee.py script -- or, at least,
    move them to the configuration file.

  * be as backwards compatible with the previous workflow as possible.
    gee.py should be a drop-in replacement for gee.

## Caveats

A few places where gee.py is already different from gee:

* all references to enkit are removed
* the parents file is now parents.json
