// Describes a vendor-agnostic frontend for allocating licenses to hardware tool
// command invocations.
// Terminology:
//
//   Unit: A hardware testing setup, i.e. one topology.
//
//     Units are "allocated" when the Allocation Manager frontend
//     associates it with a allocation request.
//
//     Units are "in use" when the test is running.  Units should not be
//     "in use" unless they are also "allocated", but "allocated"
//     licenses are not always "in use".

service AllocationManager {
  // Allocate attempts to allocate a Unit for this invocation.
  // If successful, invocations will keep the allocation alive by calling
  // Refresh(). If the invocation is instead queued, invocations
  // will continue polling with Allocate() until allocation is successful.
  //
  // Returns:
  //   * NOT_FOUND if the Unit is not known to the server
  //   * INVALID_ARGUMENT if the request is malformed (see request type for
  //     details)

  // Refresh refreshes a allocation while an invocation is still
  // potentially using the Unit. If the invocation fails to refresh the
  // allocation, the Unit may be allocated to another invocation.

  //     should kill the invocation.

  // Release immediately returns an allocated Unit to the pool. This

  //   * NOT_FOUND if the allocation is not known to the server.
