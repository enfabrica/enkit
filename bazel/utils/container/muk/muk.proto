  // When choosing whether to implement a RUN as a `command` or as a new custom

  // overhead for different types of commands, but it is useful in particular
  // scenarios:
  //
  // 1. When the step is tough to get right: `apt install` of packages is an
  // example - normally we do `apt install foo` on the commandline, but the best
  // way in Dockerfiles is something like:
  // * run apt with particular noninteractive environment vars
  // * run apt update
  // * add -y switch to apt install
  // * clean up apt temp data when done
  // ...which adds noise to each `apt install` line. In these cases, intent is
  // best kept with a custom Action, letting the tool do the generation of the
  // command.
  //
  // 2. When there are multiple ways to do it - adding apt repos is commonly
  // done via `curl`ing some GPG key followed by writing to an apt repo list
  // file - but where to store the key, curl flags, what list file (appending to
  // the general file vs a dedicated file) varies. Having a custom action can
  // ensure that there is one "right" way to enforce conventions.
