// Prioritizer is an object capable of sorting a queue in order of priority.
//
// In order for the prioritizer to have enough data to make the prioritization
// decision, it must be invoked every time an entry is queued and dequeued, and
// every time a license is allocated and released.
//
// Prioritizers are NOT thread safe. The caller must guarantee that the use of
// any method is serialized.

	//
	// Note that an invocation may be dequeued because it is expired,
	// because the user withdrew the request, or because an allocation
	// is now possible.
	// In this last case, OnDequeue() will be followed by an OnAllocate()
	// call.

	// for example, a client timed out while holding a license.

		// To explain this code, let's start from some definitions:
		//
		// uqp = (Priority - dequeued) = represents a "per user queue
		//   position". For user "foo", uqp 0 is the first entry, uqp
		//   1 is the second entry, uqp 2 is the third entry...
		//   no matter the real position of the entry in the global
		//   queue. Sorting a global queue by the "uqp" of each user
		//   will ensure that invocations are allocated evenly by user,
		//   as the queue will alternate between users.
		//
		// uqa = uqp + allocations = gives us a number we can use so
		//   users with fewer entries in the queue are prioritized first.
		//
		// Example:
		//   OnAllocate: User A=10, User B=0
		//
		//          Queue is:  A  A  A  A  A  B  A  A  B  B  B  B  B  B
		//               uqp:  0  1  2  3  4  0  5  6  1  2  3  4  5  6
		//               uqa: 10 11 12 13 14  0  15 16 1  2  3  4  5  6
		//
		// -> After sorting by uqa, all requests from B will be served first.
		//
		// Let's say A and B queue more requests, and a 3rd user comes by:
		//
		//   OnAllocate: User A=10, User B=6, User C=0
		//          Queue is:  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  B  B  B  B  B  C  C
		//               uqp:  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  0  1  2  3  4  0  1
		//               uqa: 10 11 12 13 14 15 16  6  7  8  9 10  0  1
		//
		// -> C will take precendence. Then B will queue 4 more licenses.
		//    A and B at that point will be even and start competing
		//    equally for the next slots, with C still taking priority.
